I spend a lot of time building and debugging (mostly debugging)
computational models: network models, agent-based
simulations, and data integrations. 

Much of what I do fails, behaves oddly,
or (if I am lucky) works under narrow assumptions.

This notebook is a place to document those moments:
model diagnostics, partial ideas, negative results,
and conceptual things.
